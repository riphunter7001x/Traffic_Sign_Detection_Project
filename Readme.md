# Traffic Sign Detection Project


This project is a computer vision application that uses deep learning techniques to detect and classify traffic signs in real-time. The system can be used to improve road safety and assist autonomous vehicles in identifying and interpreting road signs.

## Features
-Real-time traffic sign detection and classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN).\
-Support for multiple traffic sign classes, including stop, yield, speed limit, and no entry signs.\
-Automatic image preprocessing and feature extraction to improve detection accuracy.\
-Easy integration with existing systems through a RESTful API.

## Requirements
Python 3.x\
OpenCV\
TensorFlow \
Google colab

## Getting Started
To use the traffic sign detection system, follow these steps:

-Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.\
-Download the pre-trained CNN model and place it in the models     folder.\
-The model can be trained using Google Colab, by following the instructions in the train_model.ipynb notebook.\
-For more detailed instructions, please refer to the documentation in the docs folder.
