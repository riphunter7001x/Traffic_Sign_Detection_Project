# Traffic Sign Detection Project

This project utilizes YOLOv8, an advanced version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, for real-time traffic sign detection and classification. By leveraging deep learning techniques, it enhances road safety measures and facilitates the recognition of various traffic signs for autonomous vehicles.

## Features
- Real-time traffic sign detection and classification using YOLOv8 algorithm.
- Support for multiple traffic sign classes, including stop, yield, speed limit, and no entry signs.
- Automated preprocessing and feature extraction for enhanced detection accuracy.
- Seamless integration with existing systems via a RESTful API.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- YOLO
- TensorFlow
- Google Colab
